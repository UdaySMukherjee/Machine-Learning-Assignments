# Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to my machine learning repository! This repository contains various machine learning projects, algorithms, and experiments that I have worked on. Each project is organized into its own directory, with its corresponding code and documentation.

## Projects

Here's a list of projects included in this repository:

1. **Regression Analysis**: This project focuses on regression analysis using various algorithms.
   - Directory: `/regression-analysis`
   - Description: This project explores different regression algorithms to predict continuous variables based on input features.
   - Algorithms used:
     - Linear Regression: Implementation of the linear regression algorithm.
     - Polynomial Regression: Implementation of the polynomial regression algorithm.
     - Decision Tree Regression: Implementation of the decision tree regression algorithm.
   - Usage: Each algorithm has its own script file (`linear_regression.py`, `polynomial_regression.py`, `decision_tree.py`). Run the respective script to see the algorithm in action.

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: This project focuses on the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
   - Directory: `/knn`
   - Description: This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification and regression tasks.
   - Features:
     - KNN Classification: Implementation of the KNN algorithm for classification tasks.
   - Usage: Each algorithm has its own script file (`knn_classification.py`). Run the respective script to see the algorithm in action.

Feel free to explore each project's directory to learn more about the code, datasets, and results.
